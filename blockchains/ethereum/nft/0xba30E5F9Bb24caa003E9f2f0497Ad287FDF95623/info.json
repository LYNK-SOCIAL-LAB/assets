  "description" : "It gets lonely in the swamp sometimes. That's why every ape should have a four-legged companion. To curl up at your feet. To bring you a beer. To fire a missile launcher at that bastard Jimmy the Monkey.\r\n\r\nThat's why we've started the Bored Ape Kennel Club, and why we're offering up a dog NFT for adoption to every single member of the BAYC â€“ for free (you only pay gas).\r\n\r\nLearn more at: http://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/kennel-club",
