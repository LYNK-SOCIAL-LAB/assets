  "description" : "9,999 SMALL SPECIES LEADING THE WAY TO MEMELAND.\n\nA long time ago, in a memetaverse far, far awayâ€¦ Memeland was a deserted land unsuitable for life. Until [redacted] years ago, early lifeforms started to appear. Memeland's first residents, it turns out, were a bunch of Potatoz. Who left the Potatoz there?\n\nThe Potatoz is a collection of 9,999 utility-enabled PFPs. Each Potatoz is your entry ticket into the great [Memeland](https://www.memeland.com/) ecosystem. They make for a great side dish, but some may feel a calling to become the main course. Rumour has it they are secretly related to the Memelist, $MEME, [MVP](https://opensea.io/collection/youtherealmvp), and more!",
