  "description" : "Hashes are NFT's most basic building block - an origin point of access for users and a source of entropy & versatile distribution.\n\nHashes are governed by the HashesDAO (comprised of only the first 1000 tokens - Token IDs 0-999). There is an unbounded supply to Hashes, so anyone is welcome to join and participate in the vibrant ecosystem.\n\nAdditional clarifications will be made (color borders, labeling, etc.), but for now: \n\nDeactivated Hashes IDs (require 1 ETH deposit to participate in DAO governance): 421, 424, 447, 475, 582, 692, 735, 757, 764, 795, 806, 829, 919, 957, 998",
