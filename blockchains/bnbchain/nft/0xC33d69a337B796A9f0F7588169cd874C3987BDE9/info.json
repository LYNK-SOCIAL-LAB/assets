  "description" : "Kryptomons are digital collectible BEP721 NFT Token monsters built on the BSC blockchain. They can be bought and traded by using our dedicated BEP20 Token (KMON). Breed with other players to create new eggs with exciting traits and new levels of power. Your kryptomon requires attention and if you fail to take regular care of it, it could freeze, and to play again with your pet you need to unfreeze them by paying KMON coins as a cost. Like in a Pokemon game KMON trainers will be able to engage their Kryptomons in battles to grow their abilities and earn tokens, thus being play-to-earn.\n",
