  "description" : "A lovely house in the metaverse, Jerry and his family congregate and ‘produce’ yummy supply of $CHEESE. They huddle together in a Hole and regularly ‘generate’ the $CHEESE. With more $CHEESE, Jerry can invite more cousin ! But outside lurk dangers the Jerry is terrified of... Tom Tom is on the hunt for Jerry and their precious $CHEESE. They’ll take it by any means necessary. They’ll kidnap Jerry or catch them unaware and steal all of their $CHEESE. So they made a deal with the Tom: they pay Tom a tax on all $CHEESE . In return, Tom don’t attack Jerry who are safe in the Hole. But when Jerry leaves the Hole or his cousins come here ... Tom don’t hold back.\n",
